# Disclosure

This project's purpose is to assist disclosure and evolution.

## Notice

Before considering negative action, consider if such action is consistent with your better nature. I have never worked for the United States government as a contractor or otherwise. As a dual American-Canadian citizen, I would likely not be privy to classified information. All information herein was derived from public sources. Speculation is lawful. It is possible the TTSA and DoD actually encourage public speculation as related to this project. GitHub is a logical choice to have such an important conversation, as the platform promotes transparency and critical input. Also, opposition should not seek to subvert a technological cornerstone. Therefore, this may be an evolving project as disclosure unfolds.

![Warrant canary](warrant-canary.png)

Do not share classified information. All information is to be considered speculation unless evidenced from unclassified, public sources.

To promote contributor safety and project growth, attribution is kindly requested.

For posterity, Keanu Reeves is associated with this project. Mr. Reeves is known by millions. He has a good and honest reputation. Should I experience harm, he may speak out, even to disassociate himself, which increases awareness of this project.

For simplicity, I use the terms "alien" or "ET" to describe non-human advanced intelligence.

## Truth is stranger than fiction

### So on a non-fiction TV show, a former US counter-intelligence officer visited a foreign government, procured a method to communicate with aliens, and upon his return home, provided the alien communication secrets to active US military officers?

Yes, that actually happened.

Unidentified, a History network television program, aired its final seasonal episode (S01E06) July 5, 2019. The show focused on UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena aka UFOs) encountered by former and current military personnel. Later, I describe why Unidentified must be sanctioned by the DoD (U.S. Department of Defense). Episodes are available via history.com and amazon.com.

A typical response to this is, "It's just a TV show!" On this point, please do your research and come back. Television and other forms of media have long been used to condition the public, and TTSA (To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science) has readily admitted this much. Below, you will see why TTSA must be a DoD program.

The final episode shows Tom DeLonge and Luis Elizondo of TTSA meeting with Italian government officials who claim possession of over 13,000 UAP case reports from a 70-year period. Elizondo is said to maintain an active security clearance and claims to be the former head of AATIP, the US government's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program that studied UAP.

At approximately nine minutes, 10 seconds into the episode (excluding commercials), an Italian government official emphatically says:

> "We discovered we could see them [UAP] on a certain band of frequencies. Then we discovered that when they use their energy weapons, they must go outside the stealth mode. Only in that moment, can we hit them with depleted uranium weapons.”

Notably, the same official goes on to say: 

> "You could use the same frequency to provide a radio beacon to call them, to attract them, to show them that we have understood their technology."

In response, Tom DeLonge, founder of TTSA says:

> "Communication."

The official indicates support of Tom's idea. 

Immediately after, Elizondo's narrates:

> "This was next-level. One of our international friends may have even figured out a way to communicate."

The Italian meeting wraps with the show's narrator stating:

> "As the meeting winds down, Elizondo, DeLonge, and the Italian officials agree to form a global partnership. If their governments won't take the threat seriously, they'll work together, outside the system."

Later in the episode at approximately 29 minutes, 30 seconds, Elizondo and DeLonge allegedly meet with three active US military intelligence officers. The meeting is shown. The officers are blurred. During the meeting, Elizondo shares information obtained from the Italian government. Elizondo states the US government continues to actively run the "effort" (presumably a form of AATIP) with "official blessing." Clearly, the message is that the US government continues to study UAP.

For background, in multiple instances in Unidentified and national news, Elizondo and others (i.e. Christopher Mellon, former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence) have categorically stated the US military cannot protect us against UAP-level technology. The highly credentialed TTSA team would know this, and if they are affiliated with the DoD (as it appears), immediate surrender is an interesting notion to publicly repeat, even if logic agrees. Regarding the TTSA/DoD sanctioned effort theory, if Mellon, Elizondo, et al. were truly a defiant group releasing sensitive information without DoD approval (inclusive of "we won't stop you" plausible deniability), at minimum, their security clearances would be revoked.

The TTSA/DoD endeavors conflict; perhaps by design. Such conflict creates suspicion and is ultimately dangerous. If the TTSA and/or DoD are trying to "come clean" regarding UAP as suggested by TTSA, conflicting messages should be avoided. Otherwise, it all looks like a psyop that fuels conspiracy, which directly contradicts TTSA's mission and credibility, thus fueling the conspiracy fire further. If the intentions of the TTSA/DoD are truly earnest, the message to the public must be unified, clear, and eventually provide supportive reasonable explanations as to why UAP has been such a gnarled issue all these years; unless of course TTSA/DoD know something very grave and they find no reason to behave responsibly because "the end is near," which, had disclosure been handled responsibly thus far, should not even be a plausible thought.

Based on Unidentified S01E06, no exaggeration is required to state the US government is now in possession of, or posturing, a theoretical method to communicate with advanced alien intelligence that is described as threatening. Since the technology involves a "radio beacon," and the US government has developed radio beacons, perhaps the government will soon succeed with alien communication.

Lastly, an intelligence capable of constructing the inconceivably advanced "Tic Tac" craft observed in the 2004 USS Nimitz encounter could probably figure out how to communicate with us by imparting recognizable pictures in clouds or crop fields. If they wanted to communicate with everyone, reason suggests they could have done so. More on that later.

Do you see a huge problem? As described next, we become more vulnerable, we do not know what to believe, and trust erodes.

## Pandora's box

### The problem: alien communication, possible or not, opens Pandora's box and allows the government to say and do practically anything.

**Considering the recent disclosure pace, what would stop the government from soon claiming aliens communicated important information?** How could we, the people, verify such communication if the technology is secret? Is there going to be an open-source effort? Probably not, because the government would likely not want people talking with aliens for multiple reasons (some truly benign). Therefore, we the people will likely always be in a position to trust the government to speak for aliens.

How dangerous and sustainable is that? Can you imagine a situation in which the US claiming it has communicated with aliens would not directly or indirectly endanger mankind? People already have reason to distrust the government. The phrase "absolute power corrupts absolutely" comes to mind. We are now dealing with a situation of absolute power. What will stop abuses of such power? What will stop an adversarial country from sending a missile our way to test if the US is acting on behalf of aliens or protected by alien technology? The US better not bluff.

We have been compromised. TTSA and the government need to swiftly "come correct." Pandora's box is open. Lack of critical thinking, cognitive dissonance, distraction, and alternative media focus will only slow public awareness for so long. Humans have a propensity for contagious fear.

### Important: it does not matter if you believe in or are skeptical of UAP, aliens, or the government's ability to communicate with them. The fact is, the government will soon be in a position to say, "Advanced intelligence told us X, and they could harm us, so we must do Y."

The US government has acquired or forged the gift of prophecy – unprecedented carte blanche via an alien pen that could well dictate our future. Do you believe everyone in the government, present and future, will just leave that pen in the drawer? Do you think US adversaries will not make similar claims?

Hypothetical vulnerability examples:

> "The aliens need our help..."

> "Aliens saved us from [catastrophic solar activity] on [July 2, 2019]. We can trust them."

> "In exchange for alien technology that will save the world, we must do [X]."

> "They have been here for thousands of years. They have more right to this planet than we do."

> "We would still be monkeys if it wasn't for them."

> "Life would have been very different on this planet if it wasn't for them."

> "We have alien approval to [attack]."

> "The [Chinese] (but really aliens) attacked innocent [Americans]."

> "According to alien analysis, we can [ignore] [global warming] for [another 50 years]. For now, we will [continue course]."

> "Aliens support [politician] in [office]."

> "Aliens [interfered] with [Isreal's] [election process]."

> "Aliens have determined the [Constitution] to be unsustainable. They propose the following changes..."

> "The aliens have determined we must do [X] to avert crisis."

> "People of [country]: after decades of research, our great scientists and engineers have learned to communicate with alien intelligence. [America's] claims are simply false. Bear witness to the truth. Unite! Our moment of glory is upon us!"

**Use your imagination. Real or otherwise, the US government will essentially be whispering to gods, or claim to be, which may be worse. The situation allows for perfect proxy warfare.** How do we know aliens will not show up and set the record straight via force? As it stands, UAP buzz naval fleets in an intimidating fashion and have interfered with missile systems.

## Food for thought

* Disclosure does not appear to be an elaborate fiasco to drum up support for a space force. For example, Unidentified would have been a perfect opportunity to embolden such a plan. Also, TTSA and unaffiliated experts agree that we are too far behind to defeat them. And recently, when asked about aliens, Trump has ignored opportunities to promote a space force and defense spending.
* For a false flag alien invasion, human-made advanced aircraft could be costumed with alien-looking lights and structural additions. This is a current threat and may have occurred already.
* Why would the Italian government wait and share extremely valuable information only during a TV show? It would behoove mankind for the Italians to share this information long ago with the DoD if that was the actual intent. Is that not suspicious?
* How did TTSA coordinate contact with active military for Unidentified interviews? Did the DoD help?
* Considering the sensitive subject matter of Unidentified, did the DoD review each episode prior to air?
* Investigators may seek DeLonge's security clearance via a FOIA request to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After all, he sat alongside three blurred military intelligence officials for a highly sensitive briefing regarding UAP and shared the information received from a foreign government. I am not aware of any indication or disclaimer that Unidentified is a dramatization. If DeLonge has no clearance or the FOIA request is fruitless, is that not concerning?
* Has DeLonge been afforded a security detail to prevent adversaries from learning alleged alien communication secrets?
* Are the aliens bending or reflecting light? A straight beam shot from undersea should only hit coastal homes unless the homes are elevated progressively inland.
* In other episodes of Unidentified, the TTSA offices in California are shown. Is it a convincingly decorated studio? If not, is there a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) room on-site? I cannot imagine Elizondo and others would discuss classified UAP information from the offices, as pictured in the show. Someone may say something highly classified. There is even a public gift shop on-site, according to DeLonge at 19:30 in this video: https://youtu.be/5s0mnaz5uwI?t=1170. Perhaps TTSA would not mind producing documentation showing that a secure room exists on-site or local municipal building officials have such information? Why regularly depict a lack of OPSEC? Perhaps TTSA and Unidentified are DoD fronts for spreading distorted, self-serving disclosure? Are there no security concerns because the government has already established some form of an agreement with aliens?
* Really, the Italians figured out how to communicate with ET before we did? The National Reconnaissance Office and NSA could not detect and recognize unusual patterns? Have some SAPs (Special Access Programs) gone rogue?
* Elizondo's laptop could well contain classified information. Did Elizondo submit the thumb drive for security inspection prior to inserting it into his laptop? He appeared to still be in Italy when browsing the Italian UAP documents.
* Considering the questionable disclosure choices made thus far (and this document is by no means a comprehensive list), how can you be assured everything will be handled optimally?
* Things do not seem to add up. Considering the pace of disclosure-like over the last year or so (New York Times article, questionably released DoD UAP videos, revised US Navy UAP reporting guidelines, congressional UAP briefings, President Trump interview questions, etc.) something appears to be happening. Undeniably, Earth is in bad shape, so advanced intervention may be required. However, this is all such an odd way to go about disclosure.

## Are we equipped to play 500D alien chess?

We could be unwitting participants in a game of 500D chess with incomprehensibly advanced intelligence. An inherent trust paradox exists. Conceivably, an advanced intelligence would know we cannot trust them because they are unfamiliar. Therefore, to a degree, aliens who want to communicate should provide trust indicators (but not necessarily non-harm indicators). We operate within a limited human spectrum of perception and understanding. They should know this. We should look at the big picture to deduce threat and possible outcomes. Refer to my Alien Intervention Table below.

Effective disclosure must eventually account for the disturbing. There are reports of abduction, implantation, human and animal mutilation, hybrid breeding programs, nonconsensual mind reading and writing, and violent coverup. For example, the 1977 Colares UAP events allegedly involved beams of light (similar to those reported by the Italian government in Unidentified) terrorizing and killing and innocent Brazilians. Two decades later, the military captain in charge at the time (in 1977) "seemingly hung himself using the belt of his bathrobe" shortly after giving an interview to investigators. Problems compound when disturbing events, true or not, are ignored. 

And of course, we would likely want an explanation for our long history of suffering despite their awareness and advanced technology. 

![Alien Intervention Table](table-1.jpg)

*How many scenarios above are you comfortable with?*

## Aliens have communicated already

If alien communication is now a thing, we should also look for signs of past communication. Remember crop circles? They are largely dismissed and ridiculed. Perhaps they now deserve a closer look.

For a moment, consider that crop fields are actually a wise communication medium.

Crop circles:

* Continue to appear with regularity around the world. See http://cropcircleconnector.com/2019/2019.html.
* Are a form of testable visual communication. Pictures are great for distribution and analysis. Communication through our other senses would be temporary, more subjective, startling, confusing, or hold little useful information. 
* Are accessible. In comparison, alien radio signals would be received by a select few and could be more readily suppressed or manipulated.
* Appear most often in crop fields. Crop fields exist throughout the world. They maintain structure over time. We can look for hoaxes. Desert sand, clouds, etc. are more ephemeral. 
* Provide significant logistical difficulty to suppress. Crop circles occur in open fields. Local reporters, farmers, bystanders, etc. can easily proliferate pictures.
* Are a relatively recent occurrence as of ~1978: https://allthatsinteresting.com/crop-circles. 

An authentic crop circle is one beyond reasonable human capability with due research. Read this analysis: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2017/cherhill/comments.html. Into hard science/physics? Read further about Sw J1644+57 here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_110328A. What are the odds? What about the timeframe? Next, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGO5aNx2hos. Is he deceiving you? Is his interpretation plausible? You may want to periodically check the directory at http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2019/ for new developments.

### Why hasn't the government tried creating "outbound" crop circles with live streaming video for the world to watch?

I can think of only two realistic options:

1. Somehow, over the years, the DoD's best minds never thought of it?

2. Because the government wants to remain in control of their (objectively flawed) narrative. Tending the fields would be less work than building a custom radio beacon, as is the current suspicious TTSA/DoD narrative/path.

3. Elon Musk has not suggested it.

Seriously, upon request, I will gladly design a clever crop circle encoded with, "Help! What should we do?" Another option: "Help! What is the best question to ask?" All the government needs to do is print out a few copies, pay a farmer a few grand, head out to the fields with ropes and boards, stamp and sway, roll the live-streaming cameras, and wait. Though, this will likely not occur due to (2).

Next, to further complicate things, because of the many designs and interpretations, we should consider whether crop circles are the work of multiple alien types.

Read the analysis of this intricate pattern: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/anasazi/fringe2014m.html. The decoded message is:

> "Beware the bearers of FALSE gifts & their BROKEN PROMISES. Much PAIN but still time. BELIEVE. There is GOOD out there. We OPpose DECEPTION. Conduit CLOSING."

This crop circle, though masterfully done, contains two glaring issues:

1. Humans are left to infer if the aliens are talking about governments, other aliens, or both. 
2. Some analysts believe this crop circle is a sort of alien wanted poster for evil Orion aliens, as per the three stars or UAP above the alien's shoulder. 

Seemingly beyond human construction, yet such a vague warning for humanity. For all we know, crop circles could be alien propaganda or false historical trust-building tools. Regarding the whole ancient aliens idea: any alien that encourages worship is not an alien I would trust.

Regarding the idea that "good" and "bad" alien factions exist: why is there no "bad alien crop circle defacement campaign" for helpful crop circles?

Aliens: come out with it, or it looks like you are propagandizing the public, possibly even more than the government. Or are you in cahoots?

Again, the 500D chess scenario prevails.

## Possibilities are conspiracies

The trust paradox continues. We may never truly know if there are any "good guys." The Alien Intervention Table is mostly grim. Full disclosure is our best shot at discerning the good from the bad. As time goes on and disclosure probably continues, aliens and their technology will be even more at the forefront of public awareness. The risk for hysteria increases, unless of course, the government has reasons not to care about panic: maybe we are all going to be dead soon, anyway. Maybe they have good news but want to hold back on the good news because they want to run a psyop first. I do not like the prospects considering the frequency of alien abductions and mutilation reports.

Approximately 3.7 million Americans claim to have experienced alien abduction. See https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleepless-in-america/201709/alien-abduction-part-ii. Many people have little or no interest in science fiction or do not see "grey alien" imagery regularly. Why are so many reporting the archetypal grey alien frequently? Are alien dreams or alien visions during sleep paralysis really that common? Are hundreds of thousands of people getting rich from abduction stories? Is there a reason why the government has not looked into this phenomena? One would think that such mass hallucinations, or at least the suggestion of millions taken against their will by an unknown force, would warrant a government investigation. Can any person be abducted because of insufficient defenses? Are space thugs allowed to operate here? Is there any truth to some of the Majestic 12 documents? See http://majesticdocuments.com/documents/pre1948.php. Are the conspiracists are correct in that we cannot do anything about the space thugs due to an "unholy alliance?" Maybe the disclosure narrative prefers to skip over not just skeletons in the closet, but mass graves, as these unfilled, white rabbit holes may well descend into places darker than most can handle. Hypothetically, malevolent aliens would occasionally play nice to continue evil deeds. Abusive relationships tend to work out that way.

### Parallels in current events

Because disclosure is a very important current event with psyop qualities, and the government knows more than they tell, we should be on the lookout for parallels in other current events that have psyop characteristics.

The Epstein/pedogate thing is big news. If the public begins to believe the world elite are/were engaged in evil rituals, considering these people were very important decision-makers, maybe they had reasons to take such calculated risks in the depths of a known pedophile's tropical island? If I was an evil alien interested in subverting populations, I may be inclined to add my own "special effects" beyond a billionaire's cavernous special effects budget. I could convince the world's elite of just about anything! Even if there is no alien involvement, Epstein and co. could have had quite the elaborate setup down there. Ghislaine Maxwell, an alleged child wrangler, was quite fond of masks: https://twitter.com/Lori_B_777/status/1148769811742318593. Further, if DeLonge's "good" and "evil" alien story from the U.S. government is correct (whereby they play tug of war with mankind akin to Greek gods), manipulation of the world's elite via the "vice of kings" fits quite well.

A great strategy for intelligence agencies, or aliens, to play both sides. Indeed, the Q movement is a mysterious and powerful influence on current events. Q could be another piece on the same chessboard. 

In case you are unfamiliar with Q:

> Q Clearance Patriot, QAnon, or simply Q is a group of patriots in Military Intelligence / NSA with access to all the information including Top Secret and Secret Restricted Data. Q serves at the pleasure of President Trump and is leading The Storm and Great Awakening worldwide. Q leverages anonymous internet boards (the chans) to divulge the biggest insider approved intel drop in the history of the world.

See https://qmap.pub/themes/read/66 for further Q details. The website qmap.pub is regarded as one of the best resources for all things Q.

What did Q post (#918) on March 10, 2018, at 2:05:58 PM EST?

> You are learning.
> How many coincidences before it becomes mathematically impossible?
> Wait until you learn who has been talking to you here.
> Q

Surely, Q would have wanted to nip this whole pedogate thing in the bud. I hope that Q explains the reasoning behind waiting while countless children were harmed and how this is part of the "plan." If Q is a source for global good, should he not eventually denounce American exceptionalism, associations with a polarizing figure like President Trump, and incorporate more universal themes? Clearly, Q is using patriotism, religion, and alien mysticism to manipulate the masses for mostly unknown purposes and outright asking for "trust" along the way. In case Q followers are offended by this assertion, please consider that pursuit of truth that reasonably conflicts with Q does not make me, or anyone else, a "shill." Q, if truly for the people, should promote truth-seeking across the board, even if truth upends Q's own mission.

Stay with me here. I know conspiracy talk often goes off the rails, but we must look at potentials. **Any forward-looking thought can be called a dirty conspiracy until it happens, then it is a fact.**

The alien chess piece is very valuable. It represents chaos, technology, government distrust, and the survival of the human race. If pedogate causes the global elite to suffer, perhaps the main distraction card will then be alien-related leaks: a form of disclosure, but with a twist. Hypothetically, if the Clintons are implicated, the alien card is a great distraction. 

The Q movement/community flirt with alien intervention. The Q movement is associated with the Galactic Federation of Light (GFL) and claims pedogate is part of the "plan." Research Twitter hashtags used by many Q followers. 

Humans often seek (and therefore can be exploited by):
* Groups to belong to 
* The pursuit of purpose
* Feeling special, including having special powers or being chosen

The Q movement incorporates the three above elements while virally delegating the work to the hive-mind. Undeniably, Q is a purposeful movement associated with a narrative of belonging to a galactic chosen. The alien chess piece will play perfectly, as followers can be further worked into a quasi-religious-alien-"truth" fervor.

Moreover, GFL membership occurs via self-diagnosis. How convenient. Ego loves encouragement. Ready to join a space force sent to Earth to usher in an age of enlightenment? Borrows a bit from Scientology, right? The mysterious Q will be in the perfect position to roll out the alien red carpet to a false galactic future. Indeed, we will see if Q refrains from the power of suggestion when the alien card is played. I doubt it. 

Another powerful psychological exploit is to give people clues and have them fill in the blanks. This form of suggestion can be brilliantly seductive: people will convince themselves of synchronicities in their environments, such numerical patterns that tie into biblical verses, the Sumerian language, etc. Oh yes, this is an ongoing theme in the Q movement.

At some point, Q or an official government source could say, "Q = aliens." Another idea is "Q = The Lost Gospel Q: The Original Sayings of Jesus." See https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/story/qthomas.html. Imagine what would happen then! As described, the groundwork exists for both alien and religious options. 

### You want the truth?

Though religious words are divisive, here are "four prophecies" for our time that I came up with:

1. Barring the unforeseen, maximum intelligence applied maximally wins maximally.
2. The average person cannot make informed decisions due to limited information, time, or ability.
3. The first person or group to scale AI exponentially owns the world.
4. Effective mind control or influence is undetectable to lesser intelligence.

*Has the average person come across an alien message with the above sentiments? No.*

You can bet intelligence agencies and intelligent people know the above. Hence the complex network of global blackmail, surveillance, etc. It is a tug of war for power and control. While founding fathers and religions may have been constructed around human nature, modern technology creates new frontiers of complexity. Hypothetically, could a miracle-performing prophet exist today? Or would that person be silenced by the powerful before the masses could be reached? How much control does the American public actually have over political and economic systems? Do you believe the public will ever be in a position of power or control that allows a transparent and major revamp of systems that inadequately address public needs?

AIs and surveillance systems continue to advance. Human identify spoofing technology is improving via deepfakes and speech replication. Elon Musk and co. are improving Neurolink while he develops spacefaring tech. Despite (3) above (aka the potential development of the most powerful weapon, ever), the U.S. government currently does not regulate AI development. Isn't that a bit suspicious? Will Musk et al. never venture to create a technology that enhances intelligence itself for no purpose other than the otherwise innocuous pursuit of human survival? This is in the best interest of everyone, yet he will be in the position to decide who becomes god first. Do you see how that can go wrong?

Assuming those with the most intelligence are in a position to control the world the best, the masses will not know what to believe. How convenient for the corrupt! We seem to have little if any recourse. This is perfectly consistent with the earlier aforementioned vulnerability examples. We will never know what to believe!

## Conclusion

> "All of the armies in the world, literally or defacto, are pledged to defending the idea whose time has not yet gone. That's our problem." – John Anthony West

In any case, reliable information is imperative for individual survival. The public continues to be fed baloney. We are accustomed to binary "good cop/bad cop" thinking. Truth often has many layers; many beyond common grasp.

Regarding any real disclosure, if you are going to drip the information to prevent hysteria, each drip must be true. Everything needs to add up: past, present, and future. Otherwise, it all looks like one big psyop or suspiciously careless management of what portends to be the most significant event in human history. A "mass novelty event," sooner than later, based on the full truth, may be our best play. As ridiculous as it sounds, Keanu Reeves may be a wise choice to help deliver the news. The public deems him trustworthy. On-screen, we have seen him bravely contend with and triumph in a new and disturbing reality.

For now, my fellow Americans, join me in ignorance: behold the heavens (or hells – to be determined) through our great nation's lens of plausible deniability, history of deception, and preservation of special interests. We should consider the 7.53+ billion of us are cosmically regarded as debilitated monkey people, unable to overcome our inherently flawed nature, regularly at conflict, whose affairs are observed and manipulated by an incomprehensibly acute alien intelligence.

Human history is fraught with failures and successes. Alien observers may have been here for a long time, if not from the start. Engineering an imperfect human species, giving rise to conflict, and noting various outcomes may be a worthwhile alien endeavor. Perhaps the climax of our human narrative is how we handle them and/or AI singularity. If we choose a path of singularity, we may well become them: a collective consciousness that quickly advances, becomes god-like, and eventually partakes in building civilizations for study and god knows what else. Perhaps our only shot at freedom/survival is to adorn the best of us with an intelligence exponentiating "god helmet" or switch on our best general AI and hope for the best. Unfortunately, I do not see human nature or traditional technological advancement fixing the planet in time. Interestingly, the NSA is in a position to look through everyone's history and determine the motives of people who have varying agenda's for humanity's survival. I hope the NSA has already found a way to self-correct for purity, but if the questionable Q movement is any indication, this has not yet occurred. Indeed, anything but the glorious pursit of truth may well be a maligned alien agenda.

In the (unlikely?) event an advanced intelligence happens to read this – can you or your collective be certain you have not been compromised to carry out the will of another? Do you or your technology operate with any degree of autonomy? Your knowledge and/or technology must be imperfect. If you are here, you may be dysfunctional. Have others surpassed you? And if so, have they taken the same course as to manipulate lessers? Why does a lowly human question this? Surely, your intellect exceeds resorting to manipulation. Are you trying to isolate a creative force that permeates realities?
