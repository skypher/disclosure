## Notice

Before considering negative action, consider if such action is consistent with your better nature. I have never worked for the United States government as a contractor or otherwise. As a dual American-Canadian citizen, I would likely not be privy to classified information. All information herein was derived from public sources. Speculation is lawful. TTSA (To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science) has chosen to ignore my prior two (logged) communication attempts. It is possible the TTSA and DoD actually encourages public speculation as related to this project. GitHub is a logical choice to have such an important conversation, as the platform promotes transparency and critical input. Also, opposition should not seek to subvert a technological cornerstone. Therefore, this may be an evolving project as disclosure unfolds.

Do not share classified information. All information is to be considered speculation unless evidenced from unclassified, public sources.

Attribution is kindly requested in order to promote contributor safety and project growth.

For simplicity, I use the word "alien" or "ET" to describe the advanced intelligence responsible for UAP.

## On a non-fiction TV show, a former US counter-intelligence officer visited a foreign government, procured a method to communicate with aliens, and upon his return home, provided the alien communication secrets to active US military officers?

Unidentified, a History network television program, aired its final seasonal episode (S01E06) July 5, 2019. The show focused on UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena aka UFOs) encountered by former and current military personnel. Episodes are available via history.com and amazon.com.

The final episode shows Tom DeLonge and Luis Elizondo of TTSA (To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science) meeting with Italian government officials who claim possession of over 13,000 UAP case reports from a 70-year period. Elizondo is said to maintain an active security clearance and claims to be the former head of AATIP, the US government's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program that studied UAP.

At approximately nine minutes, 10 seconds into the episode (excluding commercials), an Italian government official emphatically says:

> "We discovered we could see them [UAP] on a certain band of frequencies. Then we discovered that when they use their energy weapons, they must go outside the stealth mode. Only in that moment, can we hit them with depleted uranium weapons.”

Notably, the same official goes on to say: 

> "You could use the same frequency to provide a radio beacon to call them, to attract them, to show them that we have understood their technology."

In response, Tom DeLonge, founder of TTSA says:

> “Communication."

The official indicates support of Tom's idea. 

Immediately after, Elizondo's narrates:

> "This was next-level. One of our international friends may have even figured out a way to communicate."

The Italian meeting wraps with the show's narrator stating:

> "As the meeting winds down, Elizondo, DeLonge, and the Italian officials agree to form a global partnership. If their governments won't take the threat seriously, they'll work together, outside the system."

Later in the episode at approximately 29 minutes, 30 seconds, Elizondo and DeLonge allegedly meet with three active US military intelligence officers. The meeting is shown. The officers are blurred. During the meeting, Elizondo shares information obtained from the Italian government. Elizondo states the US government continues to actively run the "effort" (presumably a form of AATIP) with "official blessing." Clearly, the message is that the US government continues to study UAP.

For background, in multiple instances in Unidentified and national news, Elizondo and others (i.e. Christopher Mellon, former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence) have categorically stated the US military cannot protect us against UAP-level technology. The highly credentialed TTSA team would know this, and if they are affiliated with the DoD (as it appears), immediate surrender is an interesting notion to publicly repeat, even if logic agrees. Regarding the TTSA/DoD sanctioned effort theory, If Mellon, Elizondo, et al. were truly a defiant group releasing sensitive information without DoD approval (inclusive of “we won’t stop you” plausible deniability), at minimum, their security clearances would be revoked.

The TTSA/DoD endeavors conflict; perhaps by design. Such conflict creates suspicion and is ultimately dangerous. If the TTSA and/or DoD are trying to “come clean” regarding UAP as suggested by TTSA, conflicting messages should be avoided. Otherwise, it all looks like a psyop that fuels conspiracy, which directly contradicts TTSA’s mission and credibility, thus fueling the conspiracy fire further. If the intentions of the TTSA/DoD are truly earnest, the message to the public must be unified, clear, and eventually provide supportive reasonable explanations as to why UAP has been such a gnarled issue all these years; unless of course TTSA/DoD know something very grave and they find no reason to behave responsibly because “the end is near,” which, had disclosure been handled responsibly thus far, should not even be a plausible thought.

Based on Unidentified S01E06, no exaggeration is required to state the US government is now in possession of, or posturing, a theoretical method to communicate with an advanced alien intelligence that is described as threatening. Since the technology involves a "radio beacon," and the US government has developed radio beacons, perhaps the government will soon succeed with alien communication.

Lastly, an intelligence capable of constructing the inconceivably advanced "Tic Tac" craft observed in the 2004 USS Nimitz encounter could probably figure out how to communicate with us by imparting recognizable pictures in clouds or crop fields. If they wanted to communicate with everyone, reason suggests they could have done so. 

Do you see a huge problem? As described next, we become more vulnerable, we do not know what to believe, and trust erodes.

## The problem: alien communication, possible or not, opens Pandora's box and allows the government to say and do practically anything.

**Considering the recent disclosure pace, what would stop the government from soon claiming aliens communicated important information?** How could we, the people, verify such communication if the technology is secret? Is there going to be an open-source effort? Probably not, because the government would likely not want people talking with aliens for multiple reasons (some truly benign). Therefore, we the people will likely always be in a position to trust the government to speak for aliens.

How dangerous and sustainable is that? Can you imagine a situation in which the US claiming it has communicated with aliens would not directly or indirectly endanger mankind? People already have reason to distrust the government. The phrase "absolute power corrupts absolutely" comes to mind. We are now dealing with a situation of absolute power. What will stop abuses of such power? What will stop an adversarial country from sending a missile our way to test if the US is acting on behalf of aliens or protected by alien technology? The US better not bluff.

Without verifiable information, the American public can be compromised. TTSA and the government need to swiftly "come correct." Pandora’s box is open. Lack of critical thinking, cognitive dissonance, distraction, and alternative media focus will only slow public awareness for so long. Humans have a propensity for contagious fear.

**It does not matter if you believe in or are skeptical of UAP, aliens, or the government’s ability to communicate with them. The fact is, the government will soon be in a position to say, "Advanced intelligence told us X, and they could kill us, so we must do Y."** The US government has acquired or forged the gift of prophecy – unprecedented carte blanche via an alien pen that could well dictate our future. Do you believe everyone in the government, present and future, will just leave that pen in the drawer? Do you think US adversaries will not make similar claims?

Hypothetical vulnerability examples:

> "Aliens saved us from [catastrophic solar activity] on [July 2, 2019]. We can trust them."

> "In exchange for alien technology that will save the world, we must do [X]."

> "They have been here for thousands of years. They have more right to this planet than we do."

> "We would still be monkeys if it wasn't for them."

> "Life would have been very different on this planet if it wasn't for them."

> "We have alien approval to [attack]."

> "The [Chinese] (but really aliens) attacked innocent [Americans]."

> "According to alien analysis, we can [ignore] [global warming] for [another 50 years]. For now, we will [continue course]."

> "Aliens support [politician] in [office]."

> "Aliens [interfered] with [Isreal's] [election process]."

> "Aliens have determined the [Constitution] to be unsustainable. They propose the following changes..."

> "The aliens have determined we must do [X] to avert crisis."

> "People of [country]: after decades of research, our great scientists and engineers have learned to communicate with alien intelligence. [America’s] claims are simply false. Bear witness to the truth. Unite! Our moment of glory is upon us!"

**Use your imagination. Real or otherwise, the US government will essentially be whispering to gods, or claim to be, which may be worse. The situation allows for perfect proxy warfare.** How do we know aliens will not show up and set the record straight via force? As it stands, UAP buzz naval fleets in an intimidating fashion and have interfered with missile systems. They are playing with fire.

## Food for thought

* For a false flag alien invasion, human-made advanced aircraft could be costumed with alien-looking lights and structural additions. This is a current threat and may have occurred already.
* Why would the Italian government wait and share extremely valuable information only during a TV show? It would behoove mankind for the Italians to share this information long ago with the DoD if that was the actual intent. Is that not suspicious?
* How did TTSA coordinate contact with active military for Unidentified interviews? Did the DoD help?
* Considering the sensitive subject matter of Unidentified, did the DoD review each episode prior to air?
* Investigators may seek DeLonge’s security clearance via a FOIA request to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After all, he sat alongside three blurred military intelligence officials for a highly sensitive briefing regarding UAP and shared information received from a foreign government. I am not aware of any indication or disclaimer that Unidentified is a dramatization. If DeLonge has no clearance or the FOIA request is fruitless, is that not concerning?
* Has DeLonge been afforded a security detail to prevent adversaries from learning alleged alien communication secrets?
* Are the aliens bending or reflecting light? A straight beam shot from undersea should only hit coastal homes unless the homes are elevated progressively inland.
* In other episodes of Unidentified, the TTSA offices in California are shown. Is it a convincingly decorated studio? If not, is there a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) room on-site? I cannot imagine Elizondo and others would discuss classified UAP information from the offices, as pictured in the show. Someone may say something highly classified. There is even a public gift shop on-site, according to DeLonge at 19:30 in this video: https://youtu.be/5s0mnaz5uwI?t=1170. Perhaps TTSA would not mind producing documentation showing that a secure room exists on-site or local municipal building officials have such information? Why regularly depict a lack of OPSEC? Perhaps TTSA and Unidentified are DoD fronts for spreading distorted, self-serving disclosure? Are there no security concerns because the government has already established some form of an agreement with aliens?
* Really, the Italians figured out how to communicate with ET before we did? The National Reconnaissance Office and NSA could not detect and recognize unusual patterns? Have some SAPs (Special Access Programs) gone rogue?
* Elizondo's laptop could well contain classified information. Did Elizondo submit the thumb drive for security inspection prior to inserting it into his laptop? He appeared to still be in Italy when browsing the Italian UAP documents.
* Considering the questionable disclosure choices made thus far (and this document is by no means a comprehensive list), how can you be assured everything will be handled optimally?
* Things do not seem to add up. Considering the pace of disclosure-like over the last year or so (New York Times article, questionably released DoD UAP videos, revised US Navy UAP reporting guidelines, congressional UAP briefings, President Trump interview questions, etc.) something appears to be happening. Undeniably, Earth is in bad shape, so advanced intervention may be required. However, this is all such an odd way to go about disclosure.

## Are we equipped to play 500D alien chess?

We could be unwitting participants in a game of 500D chess with incomprehensibly advanced intelligence. An inherent trust paradox exists. Conceivably, an advanced intelligence would know we cannot trust them because they are unfamiliar. Therefore, to a degree, aliens who want to communicate should provide trust indicators (but not necessarily non-harm indicators). We are only capable of responding to stimuli that we understand. They should know this. We should look at the big picture to deduce threat and possible outcomes. Refer to the following “Alien Intervention Table.”

Effective disclosure must eventually account for the disturbing. There are reports of abduction, implantation, human and animal mutilation, hybrid breeding programs, nonconsensual mind reading and writing, and violent coverup. For example, the 1977 Colares UAP events allegedly involved beams of light (similar to those reported by the Italian government in Unidentified) terrorizing and killing and innocent Brazilians. Two decades later, the military captain in charge at the time (in 1977) “seemingly hung himself using the belt of his bathrobe” shortly after giving an interview to investigators. Problems compound when disturbing events, true or not, are ignored. 

And of course, we would likely want an explanation for our long history of suffering despite their awareness and advanced technology.

*How many scenarios above are you comfortable with?*

## Conclusion

Disclosure does not appear to be an elaborate fiasco to drum up support for a space force. For example, Unidentified would have been a perfect opportunity to embolden such a plan. Also, TTSA and unaffiliated experts agree that we are too far behind to defeat them. And recently, when asked about aliens, Trump has ignored opportunities to promote a space force and defense spending.

We cannot deny the intent and intelligence behind the phenomena. Based on what has been observed by worldwide militaries and civilians, we must act soon. At a minimum, it may be plausible to say we are under observation. Observation suggests interest and possible experimentation. The observers may have calculated cataclysmic tipping points. Since they appear to be potentially hostile, invulnerable, and show interest in us, the invocation of a nonaggressive mass novelty event, particularly a direct change or awareness of them, may be our only move. Therefore, rapid and careful disclosure may be wise.

Currently, the powers that be are leading a dangerous and dysfunctional disclosure campaign. If continued without major overhaul, we may experience serious harm. If we use the alien presence as a basis for war or deception, our fate is assured.
