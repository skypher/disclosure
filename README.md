# Disclosure

This project's purpose is to assist disclosure and evolution.

## Notice

Before considering negative action, consider if such action is consistent with your better nature. I have never worked for the United States government as a contractor or otherwise. As a dual American-Canadian citizen, I would likely not be privy to classified information. All information herein was derived from public sources. Speculation is lawful. It is possible the TTSA and DoD actually encourages public speculation as related to this project. GitHub is a logical choice to have such an important conversation, as the platform promotes transparency and critical input. Also, opposition should not seek to subvert a technological cornerstone. Therefore, this may be an evolving project as disclosure unfolds.

Do not share classified information. All information is to be considered speculation unless evidenced from unclassified, public sources.

Attribution is kindly requested in order to promote contributor safety and project growth.

For simplicity, I use the word "alien" or "ET" to describe the advanced intelligence responsible for UAP.

## On a non-fiction TV show, a former US counter-intelligence officer visited a foreign government, procured a method to communicate with aliens, and upon his return home, provided the alien communication secrets to active US military officers?

Unidentified, a History network television program, aired its final seasonal episode (S01E06) July 5, 2019. The show focused on UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena aka UFOs) encountered by former and current military personnel. Episodes are available via history.com and amazon.com.

The final episode shows Tom DeLonge and Luis Elizondo of TTSA (To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science) meeting with Italian government officials who claim possession of over 13,000 UAP case reports from a 70-year period. Elizondo is said to maintain an active security clearance and claims to be the former head of AATIP, the US government's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program that studied UAP.

At approximately nine minutes, 10 seconds into the episode (excluding commercials), an Italian government official emphatically says:

> "We discovered we could see them [UAP] on a certain band of frequencies. Then we discovered that when they use their energy weapons, they must go outside the stealth mode. Only in that moment, can we hit them with depleted uranium weapons.”

Notably, the same official goes on to say: 

> "You could use the same frequency to provide a radio beacon to call them, to attract them, to show them that we have understood their technology."

In response, Tom DeLonge, founder of TTSA says:

> "Communication."

The official indicates support of Tom's idea. 

Immediately after, Elizondo's narrates:

> "This was next-level. One of our international friends may have even figured out a way to communicate."

The Italian meeting wraps with the show's narrator stating:

> "As the meeting winds down, Elizondo, DeLonge, and the Italian officials agree to form a global partnership. If their governments won't take the threat seriously, they'll work together, outside the system."

Later in the episode at approximately 29 minutes, 30 seconds, Elizondo and DeLonge allegedly meet with three active US military intelligence officers. The meeting is shown. The officers are blurred. During the meeting, Elizondo shares information obtained from the Italian government. Elizondo states the US government continues to actively run the "effort" (presumably a form of AATIP) with "official blessing." Clearly, the message is that the US government continues to study UAP.

For background, in multiple instances in Unidentified and national news, Elizondo and others (i.e. Christopher Mellon, former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence) have categorically stated the US military cannot protect us against UAP-level technology. The highly credentialed TTSA team would know this, and if they are affiliated with the DoD (as it appears), immediate surrender is an interesting notion to publicly repeat, even if logic agrees. Regarding the TTSA/DoD sanctioned effort theory, If Mellon, Elizondo, et al. were truly a defiant group releasing sensitive information without DoD approval (inclusive of "we won't stop you" plausible deniability), at minimum, their security clearances would be revoked.

The TTSA/DoD endeavors conflict; perhaps by design. Such conflict creates suspicion and is ultimately dangerous. If the TTSA and/or DoD are trying to "come clean" regarding UAP as suggested by TTSA, conflicting messages should be avoided. Otherwise, it all looks like a psyop that fuels conspiracy, which directly contradicts TTSA's mission and credibility, thus fueling the conspiracy fire further. If the intentions of the TTSA/DoD are truly earnest, the message to the public must be unified, clear, and eventually provide supportive reasonable explanations as to why UAP has been such a gnarled issue all these years; unless of course TTSA/DoD know something very grave and they find no reason to behave responsibly because "the end is near," which, had disclosure been handled responsibly thus far, should not even be a plausible thought.

Based on Unidentified S01E06, no exaggeration is required to state the US government is now in possession of, or posturing, a theoretical method to communicate with an advanced alien intelligence that is described as threatening. Since the technology involves a "radio beacon," and the US government has developed radio beacons, perhaps the government will soon succeed with alien communication.

Lastly, an intelligence capable of constructing the inconceivably advanced "Tic Tac" craft observed in the 2004 USS Nimitz encounter could probably figure out how to communicate with us by imparting recognizable pictures in clouds or crop fields. If they wanted to communicate with everyone, reason suggests they could have done so. 

Do you see a huge problem? As described next, we become more vulnerable, we do not know what to believe, and trust erodes.

## The problem: alien communication, possible or not, opens Pandora's box and allows the government to say and do practically anything.

**Considering the recent disclosure pace, what would stop the government from soon claiming aliens communicated important information?** How could we, the people, verify such communication if the technology is secret? Is there going to be an open-source effort? Probably not, because the government would likely not want people talking with aliens for multiple reasons (some truly benign). Therefore, we the people will likely always be in a position to trust the government to speak for aliens.

How dangerous and sustainable is that? Can you imagine a situation in which the US claiming it has communicated with aliens would not directly or indirectly endanger mankind? People already have reason to distrust the government. The phrase "absolute power corrupts absolutely" comes to mind. We are now dealing with a situation of absolute power. What will stop abuses of such power? What will stop an adversarial country from sending a missile our way to test if the US is acting on behalf of aliens or protected by alien technology? The US better not bluff.

Without verifiable information, the American public can be compromised. TTSA and the government need to swiftly "come correct." Pandora's box is open. Lack of critical thinking, cognitive dissonance, distraction, and alternative media focus will only slow public awareness for so long. Humans have a propensity for contagious fear.

**It does not matter if you believe in or are skeptical of UAP, aliens, or the government's ability to communicate with them. The fact is, the government will soon be in a position to say, "Advanced intelligence told us X, and they could kill us, so we must do Y."** The US government has acquired or forged the gift of prophecy – unprecedented carte blanche via an alien pen that could well dictate our future. Do you believe everyone in the government, present and future, will just leave that pen in the drawer? Do you think US adversaries will not make similar claims?

Hypothetical vulnerability examples:

> "Aliens saved us from [catastrophic solar activity] on [July 2, 2019]. We can trust them."

> "In exchange for alien technology that will save the world, we must do [X]."

> "They have been here for thousands of years. They have more right to this planet than we do."

> "We would still be monkeys if it wasn't for them."

> "Life would have been very different on this planet if it wasn't for them."

> "We have alien approval to [attack]."

> "The [Chinese] (but really aliens) attacked innocent [Americans]."

> "According to alien analysis, we can [ignore] [global warming] for [another 50 years]. For now, we will [continue course]."

> "Aliens support [politician] in [office]."

> "Aliens [interfered] with [Isreal's] [election process]."

> "Aliens have determined the [Constitution] to be unsustainable. They propose the following changes..."

> "The aliens have determined we must do [X] to avert crisis."

> "People of [country]: after decades of research, our great scientists and engineers have learned to communicate with alien intelligence. [America's] claims are simply false. Bear witness to the truth. Unite! Our moment of glory is upon us!"

**Use your imagination. Real or otherwise, the US government will essentially be whispering to gods, or claim to be, which may be worse. The situation allows for perfect proxy warfare.** How do we know aliens will not show up and set the record straight via force? As it stands, UAP buzz naval fleets in an intimidating fashion and have interfered with missile systems. They are playing with fire.

## Food for thought

* Disclosure does not appear to be an elaborate fiasco to drum up support for a space force. For example, Unidentified would have been a perfect opportunity to embolden such a plan. Also, TTSA and unaffiliated experts agree that we are too far behind to defeat them. And recently, when asked about aliens, Trump has ignored opportunities to promote a space force and defense spending.
* For a false flag alien invasion, human-made advanced aircraft could be costumed with alien-looking lights and structural additions. This is a current threat and may have occurred already.
* Why would the Italian government wait and share extremely valuable information only during a TV show? It would behoove mankind for the Italians to share this information long ago with the DoD if that was the actual intent. Is that not suspicious?
* How did TTSA coordinate contact with active military for Unidentified interviews? Did the DoD help?
* Considering the sensitive subject matter of Unidentified, did the DoD review each episode prior to air?
* Investigators may seek DeLonge's security clearance via a FOIA request to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After all, he sat alongside three blurred military intelligence officials for a highly sensitive briefing regarding UAP and shared information received from a foreign government. I am not aware of any indication or disclaimer that Unidentified is a dramatization. If DeLonge has no clearance or the FOIA request is fruitless, is that not concerning?
* Has DeLonge been afforded a security detail to prevent adversaries from learning alleged alien communication secrets?
* Are the aliens bending or reflecting light? A straight beam shot from undersea should only hit coastal homes unless the homes are elevated progressively inland.
* In other episodes of Unidentified, the TTSA offices in California are shown. Is it a convincingly decorated studio? If not, is there a SCIF (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) room on-site? I cannot imagine Elizondo and others would discuss classified UAP information from the offices, as pictured in the show. Someone may say something highly classified. There is even a public gift shop on-site, according to DeLonge at 19:30 in this video: https://youtu.be/5s0mnaz5uwI?t=1170. Perhaps TTSA would not mind producing documentation showing that a secure room exists on-site or local municipal building officials have such information? Why regularly depict a lack of OPSEC? Perhaps TTSA and Unidentified are DoD fronts for spreading distorted, self-serving disclosure? Are there no security concerns because the government has already established some form of an agreement with aliens?
* Really, the Italians figured out how to communicate with ET before we did? The National Reconnaissance Office and NSA could not detect and recognize unusual patterns? Have some SAPs (Special Access Programs) gone rogue?
* Elizondo's laptop could well contain classified information. Did Elizondo submit the thumb drive for security inspection prior to inserting it into his laptop? He appeared to still be in Italy when browsing the Italian UAP documents.
* Considering the questionable disclosure choices made thus far (and this document is by no means a comprehensive list), how can you be assured everything will be handled optimally?
* Things do not seem to add up. Considering the pace of disclosure-like over the last year or so (New York Times article, questionably released DoD UAP videos, revised US Navy UAP reporting guidelines, congressional UAP briefings, President Trump interview questions, etc.) something appears to be happening. Undeniably, Earth is in bad shape, so advanced intervention may be required. However, this is all such an odd way to go about disclosure.

## Are we equipped to play 500D alien chess?

We could be unwitting participants in a game of 500D chess with incomprehensibly advanced intelligence. An inherent trust paradox exists. Conceivably, an advanced intelligence would know we cannot trust them because they are unfamiliar. Therefore, to a degree, aliens who want to communicate should provide trust indicators (but not necessarily non-harm indicators). We are only capable of responding to stimuli that we understand. They should know this. We should look at the big picture to deduce threat and possible outcomes. Refer to the following “Alien Intervention Table.”

Effective disclosure must eventually account for the disturbing. There are reports of abduction, implantation, human and animal mutilation, hybrid breeding programs, nonconsensual mind reading and writing, and violent coverup. For example, the 1977 Colares UAP events allegedly involved beams of light (similar to those reported by the Italian government in Unidentified) terrorizing and killing and innocent Brazilians. Two decades later, the military captain in charge at the time (in 1977) “seemingly hung himself using the belt of his bathrobe” shortly after giving an interview to investigators. Problems compound when disturbing events, true or not, are ignored. 

And of course, we would likely want an explanation for our long history of suffering despite their awareness and advanced technology.

*How many scenarios above are you comfortable with?*

## Conclusion

We cannot deny the intelligence behind the phenomena. 

We cannot deny the ongoing dangerous and dysfunctional disclosure campaign.

If alien communication now must be considered, we should also look for other signs of communication.

Crop circles are largely ignored, dismissed, and ridiculed. However, now that the government is talking about alien communication, perhaps we should look closer. 

For a moment, consider a thought experiment: crop fields are actually a wise communication medium.

Crop circles:

* Are visual communication and lend themselves to accessible analysis. Communication through our other senses would be temporary, startling, confusing, or hold little extractable information. Visuals can be photographed, distributed, preserved, analyzed, and possibly decoded. In comparison, alien radio signals would be received by a select few and therefore could be more readily suppressed or manipulated.
* Are created in crop fields. Crop fields exist throughout the world. We can analyze the phenomena from the air and ground over time to detect infer hoax. They maintain structure over time. Sand, clouds, etc. are quite ephemeral. 
* Are public communications. Photographs of crop circles are easily accessible. Also, people with adequate time and intelligence could potentially extract meaning. 
* Provide significant logistical difficulty to suppress. Crop circles exist in wide open fields. Local reporters, farmers, bystanders, etc. can easily proliferate pictures.

An authentic crop circle is one beyond reasonable human capability given consideration to all conceivable options. Read this analysis: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2017/cherhill/comments.html. Into hard science/physics? Read further about Sw J1644+57 here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_110328A. What are the odds? Why the matching crop circle days before? Who could have created that? Next, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGO5aNx2hos. Is he deceiving you or presenting you with logical conclusions that cannot be denied? Aliens are communicating. 

Due to the variety of crop circles and messages, we must consider the possibility of multiple intelligent alien races, species, or collectives.

Read this analysis: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/anasazi/fringe2014m.html. The alien message is:

> "Beware the bearers of FALSE gifts & their BROKEN PROMISES. Much PAIN but still time. BELIEVE. There is GOOD out there. We OPpose DECEPTION. Conduit CLOSING."

Essentially, this alien message shares the sentiments of this project, or rather, what human reason may conclude. People must be wary of false gifts and broken promises from the powerful, which may well include governments or other alien races with varying agendas. Disclosure must be full, otherwise there is no trust, which is imperative for survival.

Like the crop circle, other forms of alien communication may exist. Communication must be authenticated by aliens via novel technology or otherwise unknown, but demonstrably true, information. However, the complexity of this information must be limited for human comprehension. Inherently, this creates suspicion, so we must entertain mathematical coincidence for all possible alien narratives. 

Lastly, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA1gF8FtyoI. Skeptics: what is your explanation for the four-way binary?

Key points:

1. Imminent takeover danger (presumably alien, or alien-influenced) to civilization and call for safe and controlled government disclosure of alien technology.
2. Carefully release and study perception of disclosure efforts.
3. Multiple types of grey aliens exist. The Emerthers are the "good guys." Those from Orion and Zeta Reticuli are bad.
4. Avoid signals/messages from the bad groups.
5. Dwight D. Eisenhower's "embedded citizens" are ready.
6. TODO: complete watching presentation

Though TTSA has led a questionable effort, the above is alarmingly consistent with DeLonge's interviews and the actions taken thus far by TTSA. Perhaps the government, out of desperation, did in fact tell him a number of highly sensitive things and assisted with TTSA in hopes of progress.

(This is a work in progress with more changes to be made.)

TODO: obtain crop circle interpretation book.
TODO: check for any consistencies with crop circle message vs. government acting soon after.
